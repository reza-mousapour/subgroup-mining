# subgroup-mining

The script applies subgroup mining on data. The rules that are generated this way are sometimes too similar so the code then uses clustering and genetic algorithm to find the most representative rule. The method has been acquired from the study "Combining Subgroup Discovery and Clustering to Identify Diverse
Subpopulations in Cohort Study Data - 2017".
